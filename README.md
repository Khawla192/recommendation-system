## Next Steps
- **Expand to General Recommendation System**: 
  - Transform the website into a general recommendation system that can handle multiple types of products. For example, users can recommend not only laptops, but also cars, smartphones, appliances, and more.
  - Add different categories for items (e.g., Laptops, Cars, Smartphones, Home Appliances) on the homepage. Each category will contain a list of recommendations specific to that item type.

- **Implement Category-Based Homepage**:
  - Organize the homepage into sections based on categories, such as:
    - **Laptops**: Show laptops with all relevant details (brand, specs, reviews).
    - **Cars**: Display cars with specifications (brand, model, features, reviews).
    - **Smartphones**: List smartphones with key features and reviews.
    - **Home Appliances**: Feature home appliances with reviews and specifications.
  - Each category will have its own section, and users will be able to click on the category to view all recommendations within that category.

- **Allow Users to Add Recommendations for Various Items**:
  - After logging in, users should be able to submit recommendations for any category (Laptops, Cars, Smartphones, etc.) through a dynamic form that adapts based on the selected category.
  - The form should include fields relevant to the selected category (e.g., laptop specs, car model, smartphone features).

- **Add Search and Filter Functionality**:
  - Implement a search bar that allows users to search for specific items across categories.
  - Provide filtering options to sort items based on criteria such as ratings, price, brand, or specifications within each category.

- **User Reviews and Ratings**:
  - Implement user review and rating functionality for all item types, allowing users to rate items (e.g., laptops, cars) and leave reviews.
  - Display average ratings and reviews on the homepage and detailed pages.

- **Improve Profile Management**:
  - Allow users to manage their recommended items across categories in their profile page, where they can edit or delete any item they‚Äôve added.
  
- **Mobile Optimization**:
  - Ensure the website is mobile-responsive, providing a smooth experience across different devices.

- **Create a Dynamic Layout**:
  - Implement a dynamic layout that adapts based on the number of categories or items added to the system. For instance, as new categories (e.g., gadgets, clothing) are added, the homepage layout will automatically update.

- **Integrate with External APIs (Optional)**:
  - Integrate external APIs to pull in product details from trusted sources (e.g., car specifications, smartphone features) to ensure the recommendations are up-to-date and accurate.
